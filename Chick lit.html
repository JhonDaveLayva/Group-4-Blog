					<p>Have you ever heard of a genre of literary that's usually centered around a female protagonist? What do you think is this literary genre called? That's right! it is called Chick lit. Chick lit, also known as women's fiction or lad lit, typically features a young, single, and often career-oriented female protagonist navigating the trials and tribulations of modern life. These stories often explore themes of relationships, friendship, love, and self-discovery in a lighthearted and humorous manner.</p>
					<p>Since the 1990s, the term "chick lit" has been in use. In 1995, American authors Cris Mazza and Jeffrey DeShell used the term in the book they published titled Chick-Lit: Postfeminist Literature. The term was used to make fun of a brand-new genre that focused on young women and highlighted their time as single people. It then start to have a decline in popularity by the end of 2010.</p>
					<p>The term carries with it a great deal of baggage. It suggests that this type of literature could only appeal to women and is, for that reason, lesser than other types. Most publishers and writers have since rejected the term, especially as it started being used more and more derogatorily. </p>

									<h4 class="example-title">VINTAGE LOVE</h4>
									<span class="example-author">by  Agay Llanera</span>
									<div class="example-content">
										<p>A love interest in the person of vintage shop owner and graphics designer Vince comes into the picture. The first meeting was off-putting but the second was promising. Can Crissy finally move on?</p>
										<p>It’s not as simple as that and the story had to go through some snags along the way before the two find true love, and each other. I find the plotting of Vintage Love very cinematic. It was like I was not reading anymore but watching a really good Indie movie.</p>

									<span class="example-author">by  Chrissie Peria</span>
									<div class="example-content">
										<p>All’s Fair in Love and War is about a group of Filipino travel bloggers who receive an invitation to tour Macau. An attraction between the meticulous, guide-book blogger Five and adventurous Jesse springs up. Although the development of this attraction sounds like a cliche: they meet, he’s cute but obnoxious, she’s serious and critical, and they’re off to a bad start, but eventually they patch things up, they kiss… it was written with deftness and I was swept along enjoying the cozy ride.</p>

									<div class="example-content">
										<p>Here's what happens when you play pretend. When Zack asks Jasmine to pretend to be his ex-girlfriend, she gamely agrees, thinking it would be fun. A few years later, she still has to keep convincing people that they were never together! Then one day, she finds out he’s getting married—to someone she'd just met once! All of a sudden, things aren’t so clear-cut anymore. Can Jasmine sort out her feelings (sometimes, she can't even tell real from pretend when it comes to her and Zack) before it's too late?</p>
