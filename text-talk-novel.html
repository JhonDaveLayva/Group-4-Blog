					<p>Welcome to the world of text-talk novels, where literature and technology collide to create a unique form of storytelling. Text-talk novels, also known as chat-fiction or mobile fiction, are written in the style of text messages, emails, or social media posts. These novels are designed to be read on a mobile device, with each message or post representing a chapter or scene in the story.</p>
					<p>This relatively new form of literature has gained popularity among teenagers, who are constantly using their phones and looking for quick, entertaining reads.

					<p>This form of writing has become well-known in Japan, where it originated, and became popular on the year 2003 and started to spread internationally, particularly to China, the United States, Germany, and South Africa. </p>
